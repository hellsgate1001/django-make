        django CMS
        ##########
        
        A Django application for managing hierarchical pages of content, possibly in
        multiple languages and/or on multiple sites.
        
        Django CMS handles the navigation rendering for you with clean, slug based URLs,
        and this navigation can be extended by custom Django applications
        
        You can define editable areas, called placeholders, in your templates which you
        can fill with CMS plugins, by default we ship the following plugins:
        
        * File
        * Flash
        * Google Map
        * Link
        * Picture
        * HTML Snippet
        * Teaser
        * Text
        * Video
        * Twitter
        
        However this is not the end of the list, there are many
        `3rd party plugins <http://www.djangopackages.com/grids/g/django-cms/>`_ 
        already available for you to use. Should you be unable to find a suitable plugin
        for you needs, writing your own is very simple.
